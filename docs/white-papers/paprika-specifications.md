# Paprika Specifications: A Complete Guide to Reading and Understanding Spec Sheets

## 1. Introduction

A paprika specification sheet (spec sheet or Certificate of Analysis, COA) contains all the technical information needed to evaluate a product. But the numbers only tell half the story — understanding what each parameter means, how it's tested, why it matters, and what constitutes a pass or fail is essential for informed procurement.

This guide walks through every parameter on a typical paprika spec sheet, provides regulatory limit comparisons across major markets, offers a detailed inspection protocol, and explains how to spot inconsistencies or red flags. It covers physical, chemical, microbiological, and contaminant specifications with real-world implications.

## 2. Physical Parameters

### 2.1 ASTA Color Value

| Spec Line | Example | Meaning | Pass/Fail |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Specification | ASTA 160 min | Product must have at least ASTA 160 | — |
| Test Result | ASTA 178 | This batch: ASTA 178 | ✅ Passes |

**Why It Matters:** The primary quality parameter. Determines coloring power and pricing. See [ASTA Color Value Guide](./asta-color-value-guide.md) for comprehensive methodology.

**Test Method:** ASTA 20.1 / ISO 7541 (acetone extraction, spectrophotometry at 460 nm)
**Typical Tolerance:** ±10 ASTA units from declared value
**Common Specification:** 80–260 ASTA depending on grade

### 2.2 Moisture Content

| Spec Line | Example | Meaning | Pass/Fail |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Specification | ≤10% | Product must not exceed 10% moisture | — |
| Test Result | 7.2% | This batch: 7.2% | ✅ Passes |

**Why It Matters:** High moisture promotes microbial growth (mold, yeast), caking, color degradation via enzymatic reactions, and reduced shelf life. Moisture is a Critical Control Point (CCP) under HACCP.

**Test Method:** Loss on Drying (LOD) at 105°C for 3–4 hours (ISO 939, AOAC 925.10)
**Typical Specification:** ≤10% for powder; ≤12% for whole dried pods
**Acceptable Range:** 5–10% (below 5% = over-dried, may have ASTA loss)

**Moisture Impact on Shelf Life:**

| Moisture Content | Mold Risk | ASTA Loss Rate (per year at 20°C) | Recommended Storage |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| <5% | Very low | 4–7% | Any sealed container |
| 5–8% | Low | 5–10% | Standard packaging |
| 8–10% | Moderate | 7–12% | Use within 12 months |
| 10–12% | High | 10–18% | Accelerated use, monitor mold |
| >12% | Critical | 15–25% | Reject or process immediately |

**Price Adjustment:** Some contracts include a moisture adjustment formula:
$$\text{Price}_{\text{adjusted}} = \text{Price}_{\text{base}} \times \frac{1 - M_{\text{actual}}}{1 - M_{\text{spec}}}$$

Where M = moisture fraction. For example, if spec is 10% but actual is 12%, the buyer pays for less paprika solids — a 2.2% price reduction.

### 2.3 Particle Size (Mesh/Sieve Analysis)

| Spec Line | Example | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Specification | 95% through 40 mesh | 95% of particles must pass through a 40-mesh sieve (420 μm opening) |
| Test Result | 97.5% | This batch: 97.5% passes |

**Test Method:** Ro-Tap sieve shaker with stacked ASTM E11 sieves (20–100 mesh), 10-minute shaking
**Why It Matters:** Determines dispersion rate, visual appearance, application performance, and processing behavior.

**Mesh Conversion Table:**

| Mesh (US Std) | Opening (μm) | Opening (in) | Classification |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| 4 | 4,750 | 0.187 | Extra coarse (flakes) |
| 8 | 2,360 | 0.0937 | Coarse (flakes) |
| 14 | 1,400 | 0.0555 | Medium flakes |
| 20 | 841 | 0.0331 | Fine flakes / coarse powder |
| 30 | 595 | 0.0234 | Standard powder |
| 40 | 420 | 0.0165 | Standard powder |
| 60 | 250 | 0.0098 | Fine powder |
| 80 | 177 | 0.0070 | Extra fine |
| 100 | 149 | 0.0059 | Ultrafine |
| 140 | 105 | 0.0041 | Very fine |
| 200 | 74 | 0.0029 | Microfine |

**Typical Particle Size Specifications:**

| Product Form | Mesh Requirement | Application |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Bulk powder | 95% through 40 mesh | General industrial use |
| Fine powder | 95% through 60 mesh | Seasoning blends, sauces |
| Extra fine | 95% through 100 mesh | Smooth sauces, instant mixes |
| Paprika flakes (coarse) | 85% between 4–14 mesh | Surface decoration, dry rubs |
| Paprika flakes (fine) | 85% between 14–40 mesh | Seasoning mixes |

### 2.4 Bulk Density

| Spec Line | Example | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Specification | 0.4–0.6 g/mL | Packing density range |
| Test Result | 0.52 g/mL | Report value |

**Test Method:** Loose bulk density per EN 1236 (free-fall into graduated cylinder, no compaction)
**Why It Matters:** Affects packaging volume (and thus bag count per container), shipping costs, and mixing characteristics.

**Practical Impact:**
- Lower density (0.35–0.45 g/mL): Less compacted, flows easily, more bag volume per MT
- Higher density (0.50–0.65 g/mL): Better packing efficiency, lower shipping volume

**Container Loading Calculator (20 GP container, ~28 m³ internal):**

| Bulk Density | Net Weight per Container | Bags (25 kg) |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------|
| 0.40 g/mL | 11,200 kg | 448 |
| 0.50 g/mL | 14,000 kg | 560 |
| 0.60 g/mL | 16,800 kg | 672 |

## 3. Chemical Parameters

### 3.1 Pungency (SHU / Capsaicin Content)

| Spec Line | Example | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Specification | ≤500 SHU | Must be sweet (non-pungent) |
| Test Result | 180 SHU | Mildly pungent (passes) |

**Why It Matters:** Determines heat level. Sweet paprika buyers require low SHU. Pungency level affects application suitability for different cuisines.

**Test Methods:**

| Method | Standard | Principle | Precision | Unit |
|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|------|
| HPLC | ISO 3513 (7503-1) | Direct capsaicinoid quantification | High (±5%) | mg/kg capsaicin = SHU/15 |
| Sensory | ASTM E1083 | Scoville panel | Low (±30%) | SHU |
| HPLC-Sensory correlation | — | 1 mg/kg capsaicin = 15 SHU | Approximate | Conversion |

**Conversion Formula:** SHU = Total Capsaicinoids (mg/kg) × 15

**Pungency Classification for Paprika:**

| Classification | SHU Range | Capsaicin Content (mg/kg) | Typical Use |
|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Sweet | 0–500 | 0–33 | General sweet paprika |
| Mildly sweet | 500–1,500 | 33–100 | Mild seasoning |
| Semi-hot | 1,500–5,000 | 100–333 | Spicy blends |
| Hot | 5,000–15,000 | 333–1,000 | Hot paprika varieties |
| Very hot | 15,000+ | 1,000+ | Cayenne-type, not paprika |

### 3.2 Total Ash

| Spec Line | Example | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Specification | ≤8% | Total mineral content limit |
| Test Result | 5.3% | Normal for paprika (passes) |

**Test Method:** ISO 763 / AOAC 944.09 — incineration at 525°C until constant weight
**Why It Matters:** High ash may indicate contamination with sand, soil, or mineral adulterants.

**Normal Range:** 5–8% for pure paprika (varies by origin: Xinjiang 4.5–6.5%, Inner Mongolia 5.5–7.5%)
**Warning Zone:** 8–10% borderline; >10% investigate for soil contamination or adulteration

### 3.3 Acid-Insoluble Ash

| Spec Line | Example | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Specification | ≤1.0% | Sand/silica content limit |
| Test Result | 0.3% | Low (passes) |

**Test Method:** ISO 763 / AOAC 944.09 — treat total ash with HCl, filter, and weigh insoluble residue
**Why It Matters:** Direct indicator of soil contamination or poor cleaning during processing.

**Interpretation:**

| AIA Value | Assessment | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| ≤0.5% | Excellent | Meets all market standards |
| 0.5–1.0% | Acceptable | Meets most regulatory limits |
| 1.0–1.5% | Borderline | Investigate; reject for EU market |
| >1.5% | Poor | Likely soil contamination; reject |

### 3.4 Heavy Metals

| Parameter | EU Limit (EC 1881/2006) | US Limit (CFR 21) | China Limit (GB 2762) | Test Method |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Lead (Pb) | ≤3.0 mg/kg | ≤5.0 mg/kg | ≤1.0 mg/kg | ICP-MS / AAS |
| Cadmium (Cd) | ≤0.3 mg/kg | ≤0.5 mg/kg | ≤0.5 mg/kg | ICP-MS / AAS |
| Arsenic (As) | ≤1.0 mg/kg | ≤5.0 mg/kg | ≤0.5 mg/kg | ICP-MS / AAS |
| Mercury (Hg) | ≤0.1 mg/kg | — | ≤0.01 mg/kg | Cold vapor AAS |
| Tin (Sn, canned) | ≤50 mg/kg | — | — | ICP-MS |

**Why It Matters:** Heavy metals are bioaccumulative toxins regulated in all major markets. EU limits are most restrictive.

**Testing Frequency:** Industry best practice: every 6 months or with every season's new crop. Some buyers require every batch for high-value contracts.

### 3.5 Pesticide Residues

**Regulatory Frameworks:**

| Market | Regulation | Screening Panels |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| EU | EC 396/2005 | Default 500+ substances; MRL for paprika typically 0.01–0.05 mg/kg |
| US | 40 CFR 180 | EPA tolerance; typically 0.1–50 ppm depending on pesticide |
| Japan | Positive List System | Uniform limit 0.01 ppm for unlisted substances |
| China | GB 2763 | Varies by pesticide; typically 5–50 limits monitored |

**Common Paprika Pesticide Concerns:**

| Pesticide | Category | EU MRL (mg/kg) | Risk Level During Import |
|-----------|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| Chlorpyrifos | Insecticide | 0.01 (effectively banned) | High (banned in EU since 2020) |
| Cypermethrin | Insecticide | 0.05 | Moderate |
| Lambda-cyhalothrin | Insecticide | 0.02 | Moderate |
| Carbendazim | Fungicide | 0.05 | High |
| Dimethoate | Insecticide | 0.02 | Moderate |
| Glyphosate | Herbicide | 0.10 | Low (not commonly used on peppers) |

**Recommended Practice:** Request a multi-residue screen (>200 substances) at least annually. Use GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS for comprehensive coverage.

### 3.6 Mycotoxins (Aflatoxins, Ochratoxin A)

| Mycotoxin | EU Limit | US Limit | Test Method | Risk Level for Paprika |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Aflatoxin B1 | ≤5.0 μg/kg | — | HPLC-FD / LC-MS/MS | High (especially in warm climates) |
| Total Aflatoxins (B1+B2+G1+G2) | ≤10.0 μg/kg | ≤20 μg/kg | HPLC-FD / LC-MS/MS | High |
| Ochratoxin A | ≤15.0 μg/kg | — | HPLC-FD / LC-MS/MS | Moderate |

**Risk Factors:**
- High humidity (>70%) during storage
- Poor drying practices (slow sun drying)
- Insect damage during growth
- Improper storage in tropical climates

**Testing Recommendation:** Every batch for EU-destined products; at least quarterly monitoring for other markets.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the most important specification to check?**
A: ASTA color value — it's the primary quality and pricing parameter. Second: microbiological results for your destination market. Third: verify that heavy metals meet your market's regulatory limits.

**Q: How much variation is normal between batches?**
A: For a consistent supplier: ASTA ±10, moisture ±1%, particle size ±3%. Larger variation suggests inadequate quality control.

**Q: Should I use a third-party lab for verification?**
A: For critical purchases (first-time supplier, non-standard spec, high-value contract), independent third-party testing is strongly recommended. Many buyers split samples with suppliers as a quality assurance practice.

**Q: What is the "dry weight basis" and why does it matter?**
A: Some specs report ASTA on dry weight basis (corrected for moisture). This removes the dilution effect of water. Always check whether your spec sheet reports ASTA on an "as-is" or "dry weight" basis.

**Q: How do I handle a spec sheet that shows ASTA 160 but the product looks weak?**
A: Possible causes: (1) particle size too coarse (appears lighter), (2) high moisture content, (3) different carotenoid profile (more beta-carotene = less red), (4) the spec sheet may not match the batch. Request HPLC carotenoid profiling and moisture-adjusted ASTA.

**Q: My contract specifies "Premium" but the COA says ASTA 155. Is this a breach?**
A: Yes, if ASTA 160 minimum was specified. "Premium" is not a legally defined term — the numerical ASTA minimum is what matters. Enforce the contract specification.
