# Batch Number

## Definition

A batch (or lot) number is a unique alphanumeric identifier assigned by the manufacturer to a specific, homogeneous production quantity of paprika, enabling **full traceability** from raw material sourcing through processing, packaging, storage, and final shipment. The batch number system is a core requirement of **ISO 22000:2018** (Food Safety Management Systems) clause 8.9.1 (Traceability), **FSSC 22000** Version 6.0, and **Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI)** benchmarking. Under **EU Regulation (EC) 178/2002** (General Food Law), Articles 18 and 19 mandate traceability systems allowing "one step back, one step forward" tracking for all food and feed products. The batch number is the single string that links the physical product to its complete documentation set — Certificate of Analysis (COA), raw material intake records, production logs, laboratory reports, shipping documents, and customer communication records.

A batch is defined operationally as "the quantity of paprika produced under uniform conditions (same raw material lot, same production line, same processing parameters, same shift) in a single continuous production run." A lot may be a sub-division of a batch, typically representing a subset for testing or shipping purposes.

## Overview

Batch numbers are the backbone of product traceability in the spice industry. In a typical supply chain — farmer → collector → processor → exporter → importer → distributor → manufacturer — a single paprika shipment may pass through 6+ intermediaries in 3+ countries. Without robust batch numbering, a quality incident (e.g., Salmonella detection, aflatoxin contamination, foreign object complaint) cannot be traced to its root cause, potentially shutting down the entire supply chain while authorities investigate.

**Regulatory and Commercial Requirements for Batch Traceability:**

| Requirement | Source | Penalty for Non-Compliance |
|-------------|--------|---------------------------|
| "One step back, one step forward" traceability | EU Regulation 178/2002 | Market withdrawal; fines up to €15,000 or 2% of annual turnover |
| Full batch traceability for all imported food | US FDA FSMA (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart J) | Import alert (Detention Without Physical Examination) |
| Batch-specific records for HACCP | Codex Alimentarius HACCP Annex | Third-party certification loss |
| Traceability as a GFSI requirement | BRC / FSSC / IFS / SQF Standards | Certification suspension or revocation |
| Product recall capability within 4 hours | FSSC 22000 Version 6, Section 2.9 | Major non-conformance during audit |

**The Cost of Poor Traceability:**
The 2023 EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) reported 35 notifications related to spices with traceability deficiencies, resulting in:
- Average detention time: 14 days per incident
- Average traceability investigation cost: $2,000–8,000
- Product destroyed or returned: 15–30% of affected batches
- Long-term: 40% of traceability-deficient suppliers were delisted within 12 months

## Technical Explanation

**Batch Number Structure — Recommended Format:**

The ISO 9001:2015 and GS1-128 standards do not mandate a specific format but recommend a structured, human- and machine-readable identifier. A recommended format for paprika:

```
YYPPQQQQ-SSSSSS-XXX
│  │  │    │       └── Packing line/unit number
│  │  │    └────────── Sequential sequence (1–999999)
│  │  └─────────────── Quarter of year (01–04)
│  └───────────────── Product code (2 alphanumeric)
└──────────────────── Year (2-digit)
```

**Example: `2607PP001-000001-A`**

| Segment | Code | Meaning |
|---------|------|---------|
| Year | 26 | 2026 |
| Month | 07 | July |
| Product | PP | Paprika Powder |
| Sequence | 001 | First batch of the month |
| Sub-batch | 000001 | Individual production unit |
| Line | A | Packaging line A |

**Alternative Formats Used in the Industry:**

| Format Type | Example | Structure | Used By |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Date-based | 2607151322 | YYMMDDHHSS | Small-scale processors |

## Industrial / Commercial Importance

**Batch Number as Risk Management Tool:**

| Scenario | With Good Traceability | Without Traceability |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Customer reports foreign object in paprika | Identify batch → retest retained samples → scope affected other customers → targeted recall (1 lot) | Cannot identify scope → recall ALL shipments from that supplier → 20× cost |
| Destination customs tests high pesticide residue | Provide complete production history to authorities in 2 hours → shipment released | 7-day investigation → container demurrage ($200–500/day) → potential destruction |
| Supplier cites COA quality dispute | Batch records show test date, technician, equipment → objective evidence | "He said, she said" → costly arbitration |

**Cost-Benefit Analysis of Batch Traceability Systems:**

| System Level | Annual Cost | Traceability Time (batch to PO) | Recall Scope (if needed) | Cost to Implement |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Paper-based logs + manual batch stamping | $2,000–5,000 (labor) | 1–4 hours | 50–100% of product (imprecise) | $1,000–5,000 |
| Barcode system + spreadsheet | $5,000–15,000 (+ hardware) | 15–60 minutes | 10–50% (moderately precise) | $5,000–20,000 |
| ERP-integrated with barcode/RFID | $15,000–50,000/year | 2–10 minutes | 1–20% (high precision) | $20,000–100,000 |
| Full GS1-128 + blockchain traceability | $50,000–200,000/year | < 1 minute | 1–5% (maximum precision) | $100,000–500,000 |

**Typical Batch Sizes in Paprika Processing:**

| Production Scale | Typical Batch Size (kg) | Number of Batches per Day | Traceability Level |
|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Small processor (local market) | 100–500 | 2–5 | Paper-based |
| Mid-size exporter (regional) | 1,000–5,000 | 3–8 | Barcode + spreadsheet |
| Large processor (Xinjiang, 10,000+ MT/yr) | 5,000–20,000 | 5–15 | ERP + barcode/RFID |
| Industrial blending facility | 1,000–50,000 (blended) | 1–5 | Full ERP traceability |

## Application Guidance

**For Procurement:**
- Verify that every COA, packing list, invoice, and shipping document references the **same batch number** as the labeled product. Any discrepancy is a red flag for traceability failure.
- Request the supplier's **traceability exercise records** — an annual mock recall demonstrating that they can trace 100% of a batch from raw material to customer within 4 hours (FSSC 22000 requirement). If they cannot produce this record, the traceability system is not validated.
- Include a **batch-traceability clause** in your contract: "Supplier shall maintain full batch traceability per ISO 22000:2018 clause 8.9.1 and shall provide traceability documentation within 4 hours of request, at no additional cost."

**For Quality Control:**
- For every incoming shipment, record the batch number(s) from the COA and verify they match the batch number physically printed on the bags/pallets.
- Retain one sealed bag or a sealed sample (500 g minimum) from each batch at the receiving QC lab, labeled with the batch number, until the batch shelf life expires plus 6 months.
- For blended products, maintain a **batch genealogy** that records which component batch numbers went into each final blend batch.

**For Processing / Operations:**
- Use sequential batch numbering that cannot be reused: once a batch number is assigned, it must never be reused on a different production run.
- Label every unit (bag/box/drum) with the batch number during production, immediately after filling. Post-production labeling that relies on memory is a GMP citable violation.
- During changeover between batches, physically remove all materials from the production area, clean the line, and ensure that the new batch's labels differ visually or by barcode.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How large should a paprika batch be?**
A: A batch should be the smallest quantity that can be practically produced, tested, and managed as a unit. Standard practice: 1–20 MT per batch for dry paprika powder. Large batches (> 20 MT) are discouraged because: (1) if a quality issue is found, the entire batch is affected — a 40 MT rejection is costly. (2) Microbiological testing on large batches has reduced sensitivity — a single 25 g Salmonella sample must represent up to 20,000 kg, a dilution ratio of 800,000:1. Some certification bodies (BRC, FSSC) recommend maximum batch size of one day's production or 20 MT, whichever is smaller.

**Q: Can multiple batches be combined in a single shipment?**
A: Yes — this is standard practice. A container typically holds 18–22 MT (20 MT nominal), which may comprise 2–5 individual production batches. Each batch must have its own COA. The export documentation (packing list, shipping manifest) must list each batch number and its contribution to the total shipment weight. The import QC laboratory will likely test each batch individually. A "consolidated COA" showing the weighted-average of combined batches is sometimes provided but is not acceptable for regulatory compliance in the EU or US — each batch must be independently traceable.

**Q: What is the best batch numbering system for a medium-sized paprika exporter?**
A: A format following the pattern `PP-YYMM-SSSS` (Product-YYMM-Sequence) is practical: e.g., `PP-2607-0015` for the 15th paprika powder batch produced in July 2026. This system has five advantages: (1) It's self-documenting (the date and product are encoded). (2) It's easily understood by non-technical staff (customs brokers, freight forwarders). (3) It integrates with most ERP systems without special data formatting. (4) It scales to 9,999 batches per month. (5) It's GS1-128 compatible as the AI (10) batch identifier. Avoid batch numbers that can be confused with dates (e.g., "260715" could be July 15, 2026, or batch 2,607,015).

**Q: Can a batch number be re-used after the product has been consumed?**
A: **Never.** Batch numbers must be permanently unique. Reusing a batch number destroys traceability — if a quality issue is discovered years later, there is no way to distinguish whether it relates to the first or second use of the number. The entire traceability chain (records, retained samples, customer documentation) would be ambiguous. Best practice: use a system where the batch number includes a date or sequence that can never repeat (e.g., YYMMDD + 4-digit sequence, giving 9,999 unique numbers *per day* — effectively infinite).

**Q: What information should be printed on the bag/pallet label regarding the batch?**
A: At minimum: (1) Product name (e.g., "Premium Paprika Powder — ASTA 160+"), (2) Batch/Lot number, (3) Production date, (4) Net weight, (5) Best-before / Expiry date (if declared), (6) Supplier name and registration/establishment number. For EU/UK market: (7) Country of origin. For US market: (8) "Product of [Country]" statement. Optional but recommended: (9) GS1-128 barcode including GTIN, batch, and pack date, (10) Pallet ID for warehouse tracking, (11) Organic/seal-of-approval logos. The batch number must be in the largest readable font below the product name.

**Q: How does batch traceability work for paprika oleoresin?**
A: Oleoresin traceability follows the same principles but has additional complexity: (1) A single oleoresin batch may combine paprika from 2–4 different raw material batches (blending for standardization). All source batch numbers must be recorded. (2) Oleoresin is produced in batch quantities of 500–3,000 kg (smaller batch than powder because it is higher value per kg). (3) The solvent lot number must also be recorded as part of the traceability chain. (4) Oleoresin batch numbers may be supplemented with a "crop year" code to indicate the harvest season of the feedstock. (5) For encapsulated oleoresin, the carrier oil lot (#), emulsifier lot (#), and encapsulation lot (#) add layers to the batch genealogy.
